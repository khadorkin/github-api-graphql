    "body": "This adds support to express-graphql for GraphQL persisted documents. This is a feature we have discussed in ad-hoc ways since open sourcing GraphQL, and are now attempting to demonstrate more concretely. Persisted documents are foundational to how we use GraphQL at Facebook, especially for our mobile clients. Additional background context is being added to the README.\r\n\r\nThe goal in adding this support to express-graphql is to provide a clear example of how this idea can be implemented which should allow it to be translated to any other GraphQL server middleware or implementation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- persistValidatedDocument and providing the /persist endpoint is still a nascent idea, that needs the most scrutiny. Then once its settled, tests.",
