This PR adds a helper function, `sendResponse`, which calls `response.send` if that method exists (i.e. the server is express), otherwise fallback to `response.end`.\r\n\r\nIn order to test that the correct method is called, I added sinon as a devDependency and a single test that uses a spy to verify that `send` is called when the server is express. \r\n\r\nThis fixes #115"

    "body": "**Issue:** \r\nIf a query returns a HTTP status code other than 200, express-graphql still returns 200, with the error placed in an array assigned to the `errors` property. \r\n\r\nThis can cause problems with caching. When error status codes are not set and a 200 is sent instead, the error or incomplete data will be cached. \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nYou are hosting an online store. Someone views a product. The product details query returns an HTTP error, but the reviews query and recommendations query do not. That product's incomplete data is now cached due to the 200 status code, instead of surfacing the product details query's status code.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\nI think the simplest solution would be creating a new option `handleErrors`, a function that receives the errors array and the response object on line `247` in `src/index.js`. If option was set, invoke it, otherwise do nothing. This will allow developers to access the errors and decide how they want to handle them or modify the response before being sent.\r\n\r\nI wanted to gauge interest and feedback on this before I looked to submit a pull request. Please let me know if you would accept this PR and this proposed solution.\r\n"

Persisted documents are foundational to how we use GraphQL at Facebook, especially for our mobile clients. Additional background context is being added to the README.\r\n\r\nThe goal in adding this support to express-graphql is to provide a clear example of how this idea can be implemented which should allow it to be translated to any other GraphQL server middleware or implementation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- persistValidatedDocument and providing the /persist endpoint is still a nascent idea, that needs the most scrutiny. Then once its settled, tests."
