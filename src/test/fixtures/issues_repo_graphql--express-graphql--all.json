    "body": "This PR slightly tweaks the default behavior so that by default the express request is passed as the context object, and updates a decent amount of the README documentation.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is to make it simpler to support express middleware, in particular authentication. Most express middleware works similarly - some extra field is tacked onto `request`. This is convenient for express developers because the `request` object is accessible from every route handler. The graphql equivalent of a route handler is a resolver, so if the `request` object is simply available to every resolver, express middleware is generally usable without having to alter the graphqlHTTP route handler itself. I think this is an \"expressy\" thing to do, even if it does not quite aesthetically jive with the deep love of immutability reflected in graphql itself.\r\n\r\nMiddleware that behaves this way & can now be used without altering the graphqlHTTP method call:\r\n* express-session tacks on request.session\r\n* express-jwt tacks on request.user\r\n* passport tacks on request.user\r\n* multer tacks on request.file or request.files\r\n\r\nNote the \"advanced scenario\" docs of authentication are simpler now - you do not have to pass a function to the graphqlHTTP method, you can just use the same call that was in the \"intro\".\r\n\r\nThis is backward compatible unless you wrote code that relies on having a falsy context which seems unlikely.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes are mostly self-explanatory. The change to using port 4000 in the example is so that it doesn't conflict by default with create-react-app - a small tweak but this may avoid little bits of confusion. Using 'require' instead of 'import' is a bit sad but preferable for now because it means that this code works with node out of the box - most node developers are not transpiling.\r\n"

    "body": "**Issue:** \r\nIf a query returns a HTTP status code other than 200, express-graphql still returns 200, with the error placed in an array assigned to the `errors` property. \r\n\r\nThis can cause problems with caching. When error status codes are not set and a 200 is sent instead, the error or incomplete data will be cached. \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nYou are hosting an online store. Someone views a product. The product details query returns an HTTP error, but the reviews query and recommendations query do not. That product's incomplete data is now cached due to the 200 status code, instead of surfacing the product details query's status code.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\nI think the simplest solution would be creating a new option `handleErrors`, a function that receives the errors array and the response object on line `247` in `src/index.js`. If option was set, invoke it, otherwise do nothing. This will allow developers to access the errors and decide how they want to handle them or modify the response before being sent.\r\n\r\nI wanted to gauge interest and feedback on this before I looked to submit a pull request. Please let me know if you would accept this PR and this proposed solution.\r\n"

    "body": "I'm currently attempting to get the request body into `context`, because part of the body contains a JWT that needs to be decoded. However when I try the following I get `undefined` for `context`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.use('/', graphqlHTTP((req) => ({\r\n  schema: Schema,\r\n  context: req.body,\r\n  pretty: true,\r\n  graphiql: false\r\n})));\r\n```\r\nI logged out `req` and I didn't see `body` in there. I'm using a [react-reach](http://github.com/kennetpostigo/react-reach), and adding the following to the `body` on the request:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  query: {...},\r\n  queryParams: {...},\r\n  options: {\r\n    token: '...'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know the `body` is being interpreted because my queries/mutations that are in the body are being interpreted and executed. Just can't seem to find it when passed to `context`. "
