Nope, it displays whenever text/html is accepted. BUT - that works anyway accidentally because it's mounted as middleware rather than an endpoint. Anyway I just removed the phrasing that alluded to this past confusion of mine."

    "body": "This PR slightly tweaks the default behavior so that by default the express request is passed as the context object, and updates a decent amount of the README documentation.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is to make it simpler to support express middleware, in particular authentication. Most express middleware works similarly - some extra field is tacked onto `request`. This is convenient for express developers because the `request` object is accessible from every route handler. The graphql equivalent of a route handler is a resolver, so if the `request` object is simply available to every resolver, express middleware is generally usable without having to alter the graphqlHTTP route handler itself. I think this is an \"expressy\" thing to do, even if it does not quite aesthetically jive with the deep love of immutability reflected in graphql itself.\r\n\r\nMiddleware that behaves this way & can now be used without altering the graphqlHTTP method call:\r\n* express-session tacks on request.session\r\n* express-jwt tacks on request.user\r\n* passport tacks on request.user\r\n* multer tacks on request.file or request.files\r\n\r\nNote the \"advanced scenario\" docs of authentication are simpler now - you do not have to pass a function to the graphqlHTTP method, you can just use the same call that was in the \"intro\".\r\n\r\nThis is backward compatible unless you wrote code that relies on having a falsy context which seems unlikely.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes are mostly self-explanatory. The change to using port 4000 in the example is so that it doesn't conflict by default with create-react-app - a small tweak but this may avoid little bits of confusion. Using 'require' instead of 'import' is a bit sad but preferable for now because it means that this code works with node out of the box - most node developers are not transpiling.\r\n"

The load balancer performs some health checks to ensure that the virtual machines are healthy. One of the possible health checks is an HTTP \"ping\" which simply makes a GET request to a specified path and for the response to be considered healthy it has to respond with a 200 code and either a content length header set, or a transfer encoding header set to chunked.\r\n\r\nRight now, GraphQL sets neither. I'd imagine the content length would be the one that makes sense for express-graphql, since it doesn't look like it uses chunking(?).\r\n\r\nDo you think we could set the content length header in the response? Or do is there a way to add a middleware after graphql's that calculates that and sets the header?"

    "body": "This PR contains a couple of new features (because it is easier to open one PR instead of a bunch of PRs with dependencies on one another). This contains an implementation of features from #75 and the small GraphiQL changes I made in #73.\r\n\r\nA full list of changes is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Updating of the eslint config (using the config from [graphql/graphql-js](https://github/graphql/graphql-js) as I assume they are one in the same).\r\n- Support for any node server framework which supports connect style middleware.\r\n- Feature for production servers which disallows clients sending `query` parameters instead using `operationName` and a predefined GraphQL document.\r\n- Documentation for these features.\r\n\r\nWith these changes `express-graphql` will no longer only support `express`, so it would be nice to see the project renamed to `graphql-http` representing its polymorphism over HTTP server frameworks. If desired I can also create `./hapi.js` and `./koa.js` files for interoperability with these frameworks.\r\n\r\nGraphQL is awesome, let's give it awesome server tooling 👍"
